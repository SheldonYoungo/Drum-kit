# Drum-kit
This is a page made to prove my skills of javascript. With this page I created a drum kit with sound diplay when the buttons are clicked or pressed in the keyboard. 

The buttons displayed in the page represent every part of a drum kit, so when you press the button (or the key assigned to that button) it will play the sound of the respective drum.
